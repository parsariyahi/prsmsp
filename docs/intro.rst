Introduction
============
This package is a middle-ware between you and your sms provider.
We just call the apis that your sms provider has and send the data that you gave us.

Motivation
**********
I needed to use several sms panels in a project and i had to implement each of them, so i thought i can write a package that do this for me, i just import the panel that i want to use and use it.
In this way, i didn't need to implement each at the time, just use the needed panel and send the data to this package.
